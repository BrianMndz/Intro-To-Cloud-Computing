# Computing Resources

* Software Based
* Physical servers (Bare metal servers)

## Storage

Bare metal and virtual servers: freed by users.
Block, file and object storage
Object: highly distributed.

## Virtualization and virtual machines

Virtualization: create a virtual version of something.
Hypervisor makes possible virtualization.

Hypervisor: software that runs above the physical resource.

* Type 1: Install directly on top bare-metal.
* Type 2: Layer of host OS (hosted).

VMs run as physical computers independently.

### Benefits

1. Cost savings
2. Agility + speed
3. Low the downtime (move the VM into another hypervisor).

## Types of virtual machines

(Virtual servers, virtual instances oÂ¡r instances).

Shared: multi-tenant: on-demand predefined sizes.
There are custom configurations (cores, ram, storage).

Transients or spot VMs: less costs as there is unused vm resources. Non-production. Testing and development. Running stateless workloads.

Reserved virtual server instances: reserve capacity and guarantee reources for future deployments. Choose a term.

Dedicated hosts: single-tenant. Exclusive use of capacity. Maximum control over workload placement.

## Bare Metal Servers

Single-tenant, dedicated to single customer. Customer is responsible for administration. Customers can also install their OSs. Add GPUs. Bare metal servers are physical machines. More expensive than VMs. Demanding environments. Dedcated or long-term usage. NO hypervisor required. High-Performance computing: HPC.

* Work best for: CPU and I/O intensive workloads.
* Excel with highest performance and security.
* Strict compliance requirements.
* Offer complete flexibility and control.

### Virtual servers

* Rapidly provisioned.

## Secure Networking in Cloud

Logical instances: Cloud network. vNICs.

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): subnets. Every subnet is protected. Security groups.
VPN: Virtual Private Network.

Build: set of LOGICAL CONSTRUCTS. ensure high performance applications.
