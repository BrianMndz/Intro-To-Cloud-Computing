# Intro-To-Cloud-Computing

## Coursera's IBM intro to cloud computing notes.

Cloud computing: the cloud.

On-demand computing resources.
NISTs: model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of config computing resources. 

* Networks
* Servers
* Storages
* Apps
* Services

### Essential Characteristics

1) On-Demand Self-service
2) Broad Network Access
3) Resource Pooling
4) Rapid Elasticity: scale when you need and release when you don't
5) Measured Services: pay for what you use.

Using technology as a service.

### Deployment models

1) Public
2) Private
3) Hybrid

### Service Models

1) Infrastructure (as a service)
2) Platform (PaaS)
3) SaaS (App)

## History

* Hypervisors: separate processes to OS.

Now we can pay as we need the services and the computer power used.

## Key considerations

Cloud adoptions are unique for each company.

* Infrastructure and workloads: pay-as-you-go attributes can help.
* Risk exposure: month pay.

Cloud gives us flexibility (scales), efficiency (hardware failures do not result in data loss).
Challenges the IT departemnt: security, legal, regulatory, etc.
